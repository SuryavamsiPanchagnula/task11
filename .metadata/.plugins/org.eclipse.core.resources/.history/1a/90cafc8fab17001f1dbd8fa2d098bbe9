Significance of using class, variable and methods

1.Encapsulation - - It access metods to specify visibility of methods

2.Polymorphism - - Here subclasses will be access to override methods

3.Code Readability - - It will help the development team to understand the code, and shows the visibility and access of the methods

4.Information hiding - - It helps variables to prevent from unauthorized access

5.Interface deisgn - - It will help to understand the interfaces of the design

6.Access control - - It will define methods, what should accessed and what should not be accessed and who can access
